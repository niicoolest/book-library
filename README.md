<h1>Library Project ðŸ“–</h1>
<h4>Entry for The Odin Project's library exercise under the full javascript path</h4>
<h5>Live preview can be found <a href="https://niicoolest.github.io/book-library/">here</a></h5>

<p>One can add a book in the library with its title, author, a brief review of the book and a pseudo-name of who added the book. </p> 

<h2>WIL/Thoughts ðŸ¤”</h2>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <h3>Firebase</h3>
    <p>
      I was looking for a free online database and found firebase. The site allows user to add books and saves them in the firestore.
      It is similar to a mongo database, where for each project, there are a number of collections and for each collection, there are documents.
      In this project, I am saving each book as a document.
    </p>
    <p>
       There are also a number of ways in which firebase can be added in an application, one through CDN and another through npm/yarn.
       I opted to use CDN for this exercise. Why? I do not have any particular reason, to be honest, it felt more convenient ðŸ˜†. 
    </p>
    <p>I also checked the documentation to check how to connect my site to the project in the firebase, and that went well.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li> 
    <h3>TailWindCss</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to try some CSS frameworks outside from what I have already used like bootstrap and material. It does not feel different from the two. 
    </p>
  </li>
 
  <li> 
    <h3>JS Revealing Module Pattern (RMP)</h3>
    <p>
      I tried this pattern to practice closures in JS. RMP defines functions in closure areas and only use variables on access. I think this is a nice way of doing encapsulation, without all the boiler plate of OOP languages. 
    </p>
  </li>
  
</ul>

<p>Thank you for stopping by!</p>
